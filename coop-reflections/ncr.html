                <h3>About the Company</h3>
                <p>
                  NCR was established in 1879 to manufacture and sell the first
                  mechanical cash register. Today, NCR is a leader in enterprise
                  technology by providing software, hardware, and services that
                  power organizations in banking, retail, and hospitality
                  industries. These enterprise technologies include world-class
                  Point-of-Sale and multi-vendor ATM software that is deployed
                  globally.
                </p>

                <h3>Working at NCR</h3>
                <p>
                  Immediately after my journey at NCR began, I felt a strong
                  sense of inclusion and collaboration. I worked out of the
                  Waterloo office, along with roughly 15 other co-op students.
                  It was evident how much NCR valued their interns. We were
                  provided ample support during onboarding which was smooth and
                  clearly defined.
                  <br /><br />
                  I was part of the DRAFT team responsible for building out API
                  Toolkit - an internal and external tool used to quickly build
                  and test high performance REST APIs. API Toolkit provides a
                  host of features to enable technical and non-technical users
                  to visually review, edit, and deploy API and related business
                  logic definitions.
                </p>

                <div class="card learning-goal-block">
                  <div class="card-body">
                    <h4 class="learning-goal-title">
                      Learning Goal 1: Oral Communication
                    </h4>
                    <h5 class="learning-goal-text">
                      Become a better communicator of both technical and
                      non-technical tasks and issues.
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      As I began learning how to utilize API Toolkit, I
                      recognized several novel concepts that had previously been
                      unfamiliar to me. I knew that as a developer, I would need
                      to convey technical information to my group members
                      (composed of all developers), however to do so
                      effectively, I would need to have a much better conceptual
                      understanding of the underlying framework I was helping to
                      build.
                      <br /><br />
                      “Domain Specific Language” (DSL), and “Composable API”
                      were just some of the new concepts I would soon run into
                      working with API Toolkit, and I would make sure to
                      establish a solid understanding of such concepts to gain
                      more confidence in my ability to convey information to my
                      team members despite its complexity.

                <br />
                <h3>Full Stack Development</h3>
                <p>
                  As a developer on the Draft Team, I would utilize a plethora
                  of technologies that ultimately make up the application that
                  is API Toolkit. Its purpose may be to construct and test
                  performative REST APIs, however the tool itself would leverage
                  different web communication technologies including RESTful web
                  service and WebSockets APIs.
                </p>

                <div class="card learning-goal-block">
                  <div class="card-body">
                    <h4 class="learning-goal-title">
                      Learning Goal 2: Depth & Breadth of Understanding
                    </h4>
                    <h5 class="learning-goal-text">
                      Establish a deep understanding of the technology stack
                      that is used to develop large scale software products and
                      a micro-services architecture.
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      API Toolkit has an incredibly comprehensive back end that
                      uses different web communication technologies and
                      leverages Project Reactor - a library that enables data to
                      be processed in an asynchronous and non-blocking fashion.
                      Previously, I have had experience writing back-end code in
                      Java (Spring), however Project Reactor added a layer of
                      complexity I was entirely unfamiliar with. I recognized I
                      needed to access some external resources to learn about
                      how to leverage this library in order to take on more
                      complex development tasks.
                      <br /><br />
                      One particular development task I worked on required me to
                      also utilize Google Cloud Platform. Although I have had
                      some brief exposure to it previously, this was another
                      tool that required me to use external resources to extend
                      my knowledge on cloud tools and processes that were
                      well-suited for a microservices architecture.

                  </div>
                </div>

                <div class="card learning-goal-block">

                      Learning Goal 3: Problem Solving

                      Successfully complete complex/high-level technical
                      challenges.

                    <p>
                      The API Toolkit front-end leverages React+Redux along with
                      a comprehensive library that enables dynamic data
                      visualizations called d3.js. d3 would render a tree-like
                      visualization reflecting the orchestration logic of
                      special business logic definitions.
                      <br /><br />
                      During the NCR annual hackathon, I worked together in a
                      group with some other fellow Gryphons to extend the
                      functionality of the API Toolkit web client to dynamically
                      edit these special business logic definitions directly
                      using the tree-like visualization. Editing would leverage
                      common UX experiences like drag-and-drop. To achieve this,
                      our group had to leverage additional functionality in the
                      d3 library and use code generation techniques to produce
                      updated business logic definitions.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Final Thought</h3>
                <p>
                  NCR was truly a phenomenal place to have worked as an intern.
                  Interns are truly part of the development teams, working on
                  real problems and our input is valued. This is why I hold such
                  a strong regard for this organization, it’s members, and it’s
                  vision. If I can describe my co-op term in one word, it would
                  be iNCRedible.
                </p>

                <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
                <p>
                  I would like to thank everyone at NCR for an incredible 8
                  months! I had a deeply meaningful experience especially due to
                  the people I’ve had the privilege of working with. To all my
                  co-op counterparts from UofG, WLU, and UW - thank you for
                  making my co-op term so memorable. To Freddi, Angela, Dima,
                  and Gary - thank you for all your guidance and support. And to
                  my iNCRedible Draft Team - Jasmeet, Brad, and Kamran - thank
                  you for always willing to help and teach me along the way.
                  Your leadership and mentorship is unmatched, and for that, I
                  am deeply grateful.
